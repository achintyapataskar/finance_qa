Test suite for Matching Engine
-------------------------------

This suite contains tests for the Matching Engine. The tests here are either C programs, Shell scripts, or pairs of input/output files to be used for testing the matching engine in various scenarios.

This test suit comes with a basic C implementation of the Matching Engine which is intended to be easily understandable and modifiable in nature. This can be used to create additional randomly generated data sets.

The entire test suite is designed to be automated with one shell script. If more test cases are to be added, add them to the check.sh file, and add a test description below.
